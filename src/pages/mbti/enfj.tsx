  const text = `In the film, Jake Sully demonstrates a profound sense of empathy and intuition, key characteristics of an INFJ. His ability to connect with the Na'vi on a deep emotional level goes beyond mere observation; he truly understands and resonates with their values and way of life. This intuitive connection becomes the driving force behind his decisions.
  
  As an INFJ, Jake is guided by a strong moral compass and a vision
  for a harmonious coexistence between humans and the Na'vi. Despite
  external pressures and conflicting interests, he consistently
  chooses paths that align with his ideals of understanding,
  cooperation, and respect for the environment. His commitment to
  these values is evident in his pivotal decision to stand against
  the destructive actions of some humans, even when it puts him at
  odds with his own kind.

  Jake's internal struggles and moments of introspection further
  reflect INFJ traits. His deep reflections on identity, belonging,
  and the consequences of his choices showcase the complex inner
  world that characterizes this personality type.

  In summary, by attributing an INFJ personality to Jake Sully, we
  highlight his empathetic nature, intuitive understanding,
  commitment to values, and a vision for a better, more harmonious
  world â€“ all of which align with the core characteristics of the
  INFJ type.`;

                The INFJ protagonist, often referred to as "The Advocate," is a
                compassionate and insightful individual driven by a deep sense
                of purpose. They possess a unique blend of intuition and
                empathy, making them highly attuned to the emotions and needs of
                those around them. With an innate ability to understand complex
                human dynamics, INFJ protagonists often find themselves drawn to
                helping others and making a positive impact on the world. Their
                creativity and vision are accompanied by a strong sense of
                idealism, motivating them to pursue meaningful goals and
                envision a better future. Although reserved, INFJ protagonists
                build strong and genuine connections with a select few, valuing
                deep, authentic relationships. Despite their gentle exterior,
                they possess a quiet strength and determination, willing to
                navigate challenges to uphold their values and bring about
                positive change. In the face of adversity, INFJ protagonists may
                grapple with their own internal struggles, but their resilience
                and commitment to their convictions drive them forward. Often
                found championing causes or championing the underprivileged, the
                INFJ protagonist embodies a unique blend of warmth, wisdom, and
                a relentless pursuit of a better world.
