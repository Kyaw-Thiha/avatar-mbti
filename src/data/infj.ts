    description: `Advocates (INFJs) may be the rarest personality type of all, but they certainly leave their mark on the world. Idealistic and principled, they aren’t content to coast through life – they want to stand up and make a difference. For Advocate personalities, success doesn’t come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, helping others, and being a force for good in the world.

While they have lofty goals and ambitions, Advocates shouldn’t be mistaken for idle dreamers. People with this personality type care about integrity, and they’re rarely satisfied until they’ve done what they know to be right. Conscientious to the core, they move through life with a clear sense of their values, and they aim never to lose sight of what truly matters – not according to other people or society at large, but according to their own wisdom and intuition.`,

    characterLink: `Firstly, his introverted nature is reflected in his deep connection with his own inner world and how he embraces his unique role in the Na’vi society. Despite being initially an outsider, Jake uses his solitude to reflect on his experiences and learn about the Na'vi culture and language, eventually becoming the chief of the Omatikaya clan.

Secondly, Jake is intuitive, as made apparent by his ability to perceive complex patterns in his environment and decipher the intentions of others, including those who pose threats to the Na'vi people. His strategic planning and guerilla campaign against the RDA show his ability to use creative solutions and look ahead to anticipate future challenges.
    
Jake's feeling nature is evident through his empathetic and compassionate decisions. He raises his family with tremendous care and pushes for a peaceful coexistence between humans and the Na'vi, despite the complex history. He strives to protect his children and his tribe at all costs, showing a deep-rooted concern for others, which is a typical trait of INFJs.
    
Lastly, Jake's judging nature can be seen through his organized approach to navigating through conflicts, including relocating the family for their safety and confronting the RDA. This systematic and planned approach to situations, as well as his preference for a structured and orderly way of life, portrays significant elements of a judging personality.
    
In conclusion, Jake Sully's decisions and actions throughout the story strongly align with the INFJ personality type - he's introverted, intuitive, feeling, and a judger in nature. His strategies, compassion, and structured life are manifestations of these traits, making him a well-defined INFJ character.`,
