    description: `Although they may seem quiet or unassuming, Mediators (INFPs) have vibrant, passionate inner lives. Creative and imaginative, they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of stories and conversations in their minds. These personalities are known for their sensitivity – Mediators can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them.

Idealistic and empathetic, Mediators long for deep, soulful relationships, and they feel called to help others. But because this personality type makes up such a small portion of the population, Mediators may sometimes feel lonely or invisible, adrift in a world that doesn’t seem to appreciate the traits that make them unique.`,

    characterLink: `Neteyam demonstrates several behaviors of an INFP for his decisions and actions in the plot of "Avatar the way of water". INFPs, also known as Mediators according to the Myers-Briggs personality type indicator, are often sensitive, compassionate, introspective and idealistic. 

Neteyam showed these traits in the plot when he risked his own life to save his brother Lo'ak, Tsireya, and Spider from Quaritch. Despite the dangers he knew he would face taken this decision, Neteyam selflessly chose to prioritize the safety of others over his own. This is an ultimate INFP trait, showing his deep care and emotional investment for the people he loves.
    
When Neteyam was fatally shot, it showed his readiness to sacrifice his life for the cause he passionately believed in. His decision to act without considering the possible repercussions similar to the behaviour of INFP, was primarily driven by his values and emotional connection rather than rational thinking.
    
Resilience is another trait commonly found in INFPs, and Neteyam demonstrated this during his rescue mission. He faced the danger head on, not letting fear or uncertainty hold him back from fulfilling his heartfelt mission. His bravery reflects an INFP's ability to stand strong in the face of adversity when it comes to protecting their loved ones and upholding their values.
    
Moreover, Neteyam's relationship with his family also reflects an INFP's trait of being deeply connected with their loved ones. He maintained a strong bond with his family and other clan members, showing the INFP characteristic of cherishing deep, meaningful relationships.
    
These actions and decisions align with the traits commonly associated with an INFP personality- expressing one's authentic self, having deep personal values, being deeply emotional, and having a strong desire to care for others. Thus, Neteyam is an embodiment of an INFP personality type.`,
