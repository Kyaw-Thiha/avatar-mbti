    description: `If there’s anything Commanders love, it’s a good challenge, big or small, and they firmly believe that given enough time and resources, they can achieve any goal. This quality makes people with the Commander personality type brilliant entrepreneurs, and their ability to think strategically and hold a long-term focus while executing each step of their plans with determination and precision makes them powerful business leaders. This determination is often a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Commanders push their goals through with sheer willpower where others might give up and move on, and their Extraverted (E) nature means they are likely to push everyone else right along with them, achieving spectacular results in the process.

At the negotiating table, be it in a corporate environment or buying a car, Commanders are dominant, relentless, and unforgiving. This isn’t because they are coldhearted or vicious per se – it’s more that Commander personalities genuinely enjoy the challenge, the battle of wits, the repartee that comes from this environment, and if the other side can’t keep up, that’s no reason for Commanders to fold on their own core tenet of ultimate victory.
    
The underlying thought running through the Commander mind might be something like "I don’t care if you call me an insensitive b*****d, as long as I remain an efficient b*****d".
If there’s anyone Commanders respect, it’s someone who is able to stand up to them intellectually, who is able to act with a precision and quality equal to their own. Commander personalities have a particular skill in recognizing the talents of others, and this helps in both their team-building efforts (since no one, no matter how brilliant, can do everything alone), and to keep Commanders from displaying too much arrogance and condescension. However, they also have a particular skill in calling out others’ failures with a chilling degree of insensitivity, and this is where Commanders really start to run into trouble.

    characterLink: `Frances Ardmore is represented as an ENTJ personality type in James Cameron’s "Avatar: The Way of Water". This character embodies the typical characteristics of this type - bold, imaginative, strong-willed and highly focused on their primary goal, which in this case is to colonize Pandora.

As the leader of the Resources Development Administration (RDA), they return to Pandora despite its previous repulsion to continue with colonization efforts. ENTJs are known for their determination and assertiveness, and Ardmore shows this through her consistent attempts to reclaim Pandora and resist the native opposition.
    
In addition, ENTJs often excel in organizing and strategizing. Ardmore exemplifies this through the clever introduction of the Recombinants, Na’vi avatars implanted with the memories of deceased human soldiers, as a method to infiltrate and conquer Pandora.
    
ENTJs are also known for their directness and honesty. They prefer logical reasoning over emotional considerations, as seen in Ardmore’s decision to conduct raids on the archipelago, massacre villages, and slaughter Tulkuns, all with the intention to draw out her primary adversary, Jake Sully.
    
Ardmore's social and communicative skills, another set of core ENTJ strengths, allows her to manipulate situations to her advantage. The decision to bring Spider, Quaritch's son, under her wing and use him to her advantage as a means to infiltrate and undermine her adversaries displays her strategic thinking and willingness to exploit emotional connections for her own gain.
    
Lastly, ENTJs are known for their leadership potential, making tough decisions when required. Ardmore is in a high position of authority and uses it in ways that serve her goals, regardless of ethical or moral considerations. She is a leader who is willing to do whatever it takes to ensure success, even if it involves causing harm or destruction.
    
In conclusion, Frances Ardmore, with her strategic planning, assertive decisions, and strong leadership, encapsulates the personality traits of an ENTJ archetype.`,
