    characterLink: `Colonel Miles Quaritch, as characterized in the Avatar sequel, "Avatar: The Way of Water" displays an ESTJ (Extraverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging) personality, a type known for being practical, organized, and direct. ESTJs thrive on order and continuity, often seeking to establish and uphold traditions and structures, this is evident in Quaritch's decision to align with the RDA's marine operations, a symbol of human influence on Pandora.

Quaritch's Extraverted nature is demonstrated throughout the plot. He engages overtly and directly in every situation, whether it's capturing the children during a counterinsurgency mission or confronting Jake Sully head-on. He's unafraid of taking drastic measures to achieve his ends, as seen when he begins raiding Archipelago villages and killing innocent Tulkun creatures to bait Jake out, demonstrating his decisive and assertive nature typical of ESTJs.
    
The Sensing aspect of Quaritch's personality is evident in his consistent, practical approach to problems. He focuses on immediate, concrete details, as seen in his pragmatic decision to spend time with Spider to gain his favor and learn about Na'vi culture and language. He relies on his background as a military man and known rules, rather than abstract theories or future possibilities, suggesting an emphasis on past experience and present realities that Sensing types typically exhibit.
    
His Thinking side manifests in his clear rationale and objective judgment. For instance, Quaritch decides to spend time with Spider not out of emotion or fatherly affection, but to achieve a strategic advantage in his mission. This showcases his detached logical thinking, characteristic of Thinking personality types. 
    
Lastly, Quaritch's Judging quality is seen in his organized, systematic approach to situations. He carries out his mission methodically, systematically tracking his enemies, organizing raids, and laying out traps. His preference for a structured environment, predictability, and closure emphasizes his Judging characteristics.
    
In summary, Quaritchâ€™s decisions and actions throughout the Avatar sequel strongly align with the traits of an ESTJ personality type, whose key characteristics are extraversion, practical sense, logical thinking, and an organizational approach.`,
