    description: `Although they may seem quiet or unassuming, Mediators (INFPs) have vibrant, passionate inner lives. Creative and imaginative, they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of stories and conversations in their minds. These personalities are known for their sensitivity – Mediators can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them.

Idealistic and empathetic, Mediators long for deep, soulful relationships, and they feel called to help others. But because this personality type makes up such a small portion of the population, Mediators may sometimes feel lonely or invisible, adrift in a world that doesn’t seem to appreciate the traits that make them unique.`,

    characterLink: `ISFP individuals are often described as sensitive, quiet, easy-going, and good-natured. They are usually deeply devoted to those they care about and value harmony and peace. They are action-oriented and focus on the present moment. Neytiri demonstrates this through her actions and decisions in the story.

She is seen as deeply devoted to her family, and continually acts to protect them from harm. This is evident when Quaritch and his subordinates capture Jake's children, and Neytiri arrives to free them, showing her protective nature and deep commitment to those she loves.
    
ISFP individuals also value peace and harmony, often going to great lengths to avoid conflict. When the danger posed by Spider's knowledge becomes apparent, Neytiri, along with Jake and their family, relocate themselves for safety, demonstrating her dislike for conflict and her commitment to maintaining peace and harmony in her family.
    
ISFPs are also known as being very in-touch with their environment and highly perceptive. This can be seen in Neytiri's interaction and deep connection with the world of Pandora. She is able to integrate easily with the Metkayina clan, further highlighting her adaptability and pragmatism.
    
Finally, ISFPs are fiercely independent, placing great importance on their personal freedom. This can be seen in Neytiri's resistance against the colonization efforts by the RDA. Despite the challenges, she remains determined to protect her way of life and personal liberties.
    
In conclusion, through her decisions and actions in the plot of Avatar: The Way of Water, Neytiri consistently aligns with the traits of an ISFP. These are shown through her deep devotion to her family, her actions to maintain peace and avoid conflict, her perceptive connection to the environment around her, and her stance for personal freedom.`,
