    description: `In their unassuming, understated way, Defenders help make the world go round. Hardworking and devoted, people with this personality type feel a deep sense of responsibility to those around them. Defenders can be counted on to meet deadlines, remember birthdays and special occasions, uphold traditions, and shower their loved ones with gestures of care and support. But they rarely demand recognition for all that they do, preferring instead to operate behind the scenes.

    This is a capable, can-do personality type, with a wealth of versatile gifts. Though sensitive and caring, Defenders also have excellent analytical abilities and an eye for detail. And despite their reserve, they tend to have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships. Defenders are truly more than the sum of their parts, and their varied strengths shine in even the most ordinary aspects of their daily lives.`,

    characterLink: `An influential factor in affirming his ISFJ personality trait is his relationship with others. He demonstrates his caring nature while engaging with Payakan, the intelligent and pacifist whale-like species. From him, he absorbs the pain and injustice experienced after being cast out due to an attack on human whalers. This empathetic tendency marks a key trait of ISFJs, who are known for their compassionate and kind nature.

Throughout the plot, he also evidences a strong commitment to harmony, a pivotal ISFJ personality trait. He apologizes for initiating a fight, accepts blame for a dangerous hunting trip which he did not instigate, and befriends the outcast, Payakan. These actions reflect his inner sense of responsibility and desire to maintain harmony, common traits in those with an ISFJ personality.
    
Lo'ak's actions in stressful situations also hint at his ISFJ personality. When his sister Kiri suffers a seizure, he supports his family, revealing his protective nature, characteristic of ISFJs. Furthermore, his choice to warn Payakan about the impending Tulkun killings signifies his innate instinct to protect and help those whom he has formed deep connections with.
    
These instances illuminate Lo'ak's integrity, loyalty, and altruism, underlining his ISFJ personality type, and his consistent application of these traits throughout the plot reinforces this reasoning. He is compassionate, understanding, and prone to go out of his way to take care of others, even at his own risk - common traits of an ISFJ personality.`,
