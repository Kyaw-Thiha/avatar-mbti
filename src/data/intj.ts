    description: `It can be lonely at the top. As one of the rarest personality types – and one of the most capable – Architects (INTJs) know this all too well. Rational and quick-witted, Architects pride themselves on their ability to think for themselves, not to mention their uncanny knack for seeing right through phoniness and hypocrisy. But because their minds are never at rest, Architects may struggle to find people who can keep up with their nonstop analysis of everything around them.

    characterLink: `Norm Spellman, recurring in the sequel "Avatar: The Way of Water", is clearly characterized by an INTJ personality, which stands for Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging on the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). While the plot summary does not provide extensive detail about Norm's role in the film, there are several instances hinting at his personality.

The first glimpse of Norm's INTJ personality is evident in his role as a scientist. The research and dedication necessary for such a role align with the deep interest and focus often seen in INTJs. Furthermore, his decision to stay on Pandora despite the potential dangers indicates his analytical and strategic thinking--traits associated with the INTJs capacity for thorough planning. Contrary to relying on the immediate external circumstance, Norm seems to base his actions on long-term future-oriented thinking, central to INTJs.
    
Moreover, his ability to diagnose Kiri's condition as epilepsy when she fell into a trance and nearly drowned after linking to the underwater Spirit Tree demonstrates another essential aspect of the INTJ personality, which is problem-solving. Faced with a mysterious medical crisis, Norm was able to consider various possibilities and narrow down the cause. This synthesis of information is indicative of INTJ's powerful intuitive and strategic thinking capabilities.
    
Lastly, Norm's decision to go to Pandora, despite the clear potential risks, reveals his judging trait - a preference for planned, decided activities instead of spontaneity. Norm's adherence to his commitment to the situation on Pandora despite the danger reiterates his preference for a methodical approach and unwavering dedication to his decisions.
    
Although some key characteristics of the INTJ personality type like introversion are not apparent from the given plot due to the lack of information about Norm's interpersonal relationships, his decisions and actions clearly reflect the INTJ's robust strategic, future-oriented thinking and commitment to decided actions.`,
